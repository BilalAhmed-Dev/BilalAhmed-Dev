### Hi there, I'm Bilal Ahmed 👋,
Full-stack developer with three years of experience shipping production features end-to-end. I lead with React/Next.js on the front, Java/Spring Boot or Node.js APIs on the back, and lean on AWS for secure deployments. I focus on building new features, hardening reliability, automating tasks, and shortening release cycles.
